# Traffic Light System
This is a basic Traffic Light Simulation program built using Java. The program mimics the behavior of traffic lights by prompting the user to enter a light color and then displays the corresponding action (Stop, Prepare to stop, or Go). The user can exit the program by typing "exit".

## Features
Color Input: Accepts traffic light colors (Red, Yellow, Green).
Light-Based Actions: Displays the appropriate action for each light:
Red: Stop
Yellow: Prepare to stop
Green: Go
Exit Option: Allows the user to exit the program by typing "exit".

## Project Structure
The code is written in a single traffic class, and it utilizes a simple loop to continually prompt the user for input. Depending on the input, the program performs different actions as per traffic light rules.

Red: Displays "Action: Stop".
Yellow: Displays "Action: Prepare to stop".
Green: Displays "Action: Go".
Exit: Stops the program when the user types "exit".

## Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for implementing the traffic light system.
Scanner Class: Used for accepting user input from the console.
